Shashank Shekhar's website https://shashank7200.github.io/

This webpage is based on the Aerial theme by HTML5 UP, a single page, single screen responsive site template.Makes heavy use of CSS animation. Works well as a landing page that just directs folks to your stuff elsewhere on the www, though I'm planning to mix it up.
